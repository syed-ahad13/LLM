# Decision log

Add one entry for each decision that affects the data, the tokenizer or the report. Put the newest entry last. Point to evidence files or stats rather than pasting large outputs.

## Template

### YYYY-MM-DD: short title
- **Decision:** what we will do, in one or two sentences.
- **Options considered:** each alternative and why it lost.
- **Evidence:** numbers, samples or files (`data/stats/…`, `evidence/…`, `analysis/samples/…`), or the handout section.
- **Consequence:** what this changes downstream (corpus, tokenizer, report, next assignment), and what would make us revisit it.

## Entries

### 2026-10-11: docs/assignment.md is a verbatim transcription of the course PDF
- **Decision:** We transcribed the handout PDF into `docs/assignment.md`, which CLAUDE.md names as the authoritative spec. The wording is unchanged. We added only formatting and a clearly marked "Transcription notes" section.
- **Options considered:**
  - Keep only the PDF. Rejected: later sessions cannot search or quote it reliably, and the Urdu examples would need re-extracting each time.
  - Write a summary. Rejected: summaries drift from the source.
  - Verbatim transcription with provenance. Chosen.
- **Evidence:**
  - Source: `Assignment 1 - Urdu BPE Tokenizer from Scratch.pdf`, 5 pages, sha256 `c82bc6fb7d5738402c7ad717c4fac6fe6b9d71bcbc48f2e09d311afe2cfa10a2`.
  - The Urdu examples were checked code point by code point, and the PDF contains no presentation forms.
  - Extraction shows a gap in the GPT-2 regex (`| ? \p{L}+`). It is a text-run break before each `\`, and the same artifact appears in `[^ \s`.
  - Link targets come from the PDF's annotations.
- **Consequence:** Two gaps in the original are recorded, not filled:
  - Part C says "Answer five questions" but lists three.
  - The reference trainer must pass "the sanity check below", but the handout contains none.

  Ask the instructor about both before writing the report or finalizing the reference-trainer tests.
